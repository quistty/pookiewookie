Ok the structure we should have for the github thing:

- when you have a change you want to upload to the project, we should pull request the thing, the other person should go on github and review the request and see whats wrong, and submit the review.
- If later on we find issues, we should publish an issue and make a thingiie
- sooo create a new branch and edit/commit to that branch (working, testing, prod)
- to create a pull request (which basically merges our working baranch into our main branch), click the pull thingie shortcut
