Ok the structure we should have for the github thing:

- when you have a change you want to upload to the project, we should pull request the thing, the other person should go on github and review the request and see whats wrong, and submit the review.
- If later on we find issues, we should publish an issue and make a thingiie
- sooo create a new branch and edit/commit to that branch (working, testing, prod)
- to create a pull request (which basically merges our working baranch into our main branch), click the pull thingie shortcut

- make edit
- go to source control and commit those edits (dont forget to add a description otherwise it will not commit)
- sync with the file (so basically if i make an edit it's synced)
- once you think these edits are good and should be reviewed by the other person, make a pull request to update the main branch
    - to update the main branch, click the pull request button, and add create a name/description for the things you did
    - a menu should pop up after you click create. go to the left hand side where reviewers is and click the gear cog. Add the other person
    - you can add comments with more information like the stuff to check and review (dont forget to document the test cases you use when you test your stuff)
- once the code has been reviewed, the merge should be performed :D

# how to review the code
- go to the github website https://github.com/quistty/pookiewookie/tree/working and make sure you're under the working tree
- click pull requests in the top right and click the one that has the action you want to review
- click files changed and look at what has been changed. You can review the code and make sure it functions (by clicking rewview in codespace). If it doesnt, edit it in the codespace and commit it again (it will go into the created pull request)
- when it makes sense just commit the code

# WHAT AM I ABOUT TO DO UPSTAIRS
